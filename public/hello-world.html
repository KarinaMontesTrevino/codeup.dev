     	   <p> <h1> A little about me: </h1></p>

           <p> My name is <strong> Karina Montes.</strong><br> I was born in Mexico City and I'm currently learning <em>how to program.</em> I recently graduated from UTSA. <br> Fun fact: I took one semester of Japanese because I wan't to travel to Japan</p>     	
           <p> <h2>One of my favorite quotes is:</h2> <blockquote>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. <strong> -Michael Jordan</strong></blockquote></p>
