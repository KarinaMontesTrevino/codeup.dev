		 <h2>FAQ About National Parks</h2>
	    
	     <dl>
		      <dt><dfn>1. How imminent is an eruption of the Yellowstone Volcano?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>A. There is no evidence that a catastrophic eruption at Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is imminent. Current geologic activity at Yellowstone has remained relatively constant since earth scientists first started monitoring some 30 years ago.</dd>

		      <dt><dfn>2. Can I drive my private vehicle into Zion Canyon?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>A. From April to October access into the canyon is by free shuttle bus only. Private vehicles are allowed to access the canyon from November to mid March
			      </dd>

			  <dt><dfn>3. Do I need a reservation to visit Yosemite?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>A. No, you don't need a reservation to visit Yosemite. However, if you plan to spend the night in Yosemite, you should have a reservation for lodging, camping, or backpacking. (Hookups are not available in any Yosemite campgrounds.)
		          </dd>

		      <dt><dfn>4. Why is it called Death Valley?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>A. Death Valley was given its forbidding name by a group of pioneers lost here in the winter of 1849-1850. Even though, as far as we know, only one of the group died here, they all assumed that this valley would be their grave. They were rescued by two of their young men, William Lewis Manly and John Rogers, who had learned to be scouts. As the party climbed out of the valley over the Panamint Mountains, one of the men turned, looked back, and said "goodbye, Death Valley." This name, and the story of The Lost '49ers have become part of our western history.
		          </dd>

		      <dt><dfn>5. What is the best driving route to take to Acadia from the south?</dfn></dt>

Rio Grande Village and Basin campgrounds have dump stations and water. Camping is not allowed in parking lots or along roadways.
			      </dd>

			  <dt><dfn>8. How many volcanoes are there on the Big Island?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>

				   </dd>

			   <dt><dfn>9. Can I backpack in Arches?</dfn></dt>
			      <dd>
			      	  A. Yes, although there just a few areas where backpacking is allowed. 
		          </dd>

		       <dt><dfn>10. What is the acreage of the park?</dfn></dt>

		        <li>There are 747,956 acres of land in Yosemite National Park.</li>
		    </ul>
	    <h3>Yellowstone</h3>
		    <ul id="yellowstone-facts">
		        <li>There are over 40 major waterfalls in Yellowstone.</li>
		        <li>Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, 20 years before Montana, Idaho and Wyoming were granted statehood.</li>

		        <li>In the year 1992, Yellowstone National Park hit a record high number of visitors - over 3 Million visitors in 1 year.</li>
		    </ul>
		<h3>Death Valley</h3>
		    <ul id="deathvalley-facts">
		        <li>Historically, Death Valley has been home to Native American tribes and today, the Timbisha tribe, which has been in the valley for at least 1,000 years, inhabits the region.</li>
		        <li>On February 11, 1933, Death Valley was made a National Monument by President Herbert Hoover. In 1994, the area was re-designated as  a National Park.</li>
		        <li>Dozens of scenes from Star Wars have been filmed in Death Valley, including Artist's Palette (the Sandcrawler scene from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), Golden Canyon (Jawa scenes from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) and Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes (Droid scenes from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope). Blogger Steve Hall does an amazing job of lining up film scenes and locations!</li>
		        <li>Scientists can't agree how old Ubehebe Crater is. Initial research believed it's between 2,000 to 7,000 years old, but new findings peg it at 800 years old. But everyone agree it's huge - half a mile wide and 500 to 777 feet deep.</li>
