           <p> My name is <strong> Karina Montes.</strong><br> I was born in Mexico City and I'm currently learning <em>how to program.</em> I recently graduated from UTSA. <br> Fun fact: I took one semester of Japanese because I believe in another life I lived in Japan.</p>     	
            <blockquote>"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. <em>I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."</em> <strong> -Michael Jordan</strong></blockquote></p>

            <h2>My Vehicle</h2>
            <p>The Peugeot <strong>Metromorph Concept</strong>is a futurstic urban electric vehicle created for a city with vertical roads integrated into buildings. It can be transformed into a personal balcony to save parking space and time. The author is Roman Mistiuk from San Francisco. The Peugeot Metromorph Concept is a two seater futuristic urban vehicle that aims at solving the parking problem in an original way. Taking inspiration from the <em>"Minority Report"</em>Sci-fi movie, designer <strong>Roman Mistiuk </strong> has imagined a futuristic urban enironment where the side surfaces of the buildings integrate vertical roads that can be climbed up by special cars, which can be parked next to the owner apartment windows. In addition to this, the Metromorph goes a step further, as it can be transformed into a balcony.</p>
