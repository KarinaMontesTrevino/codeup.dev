            <blockquote>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. <em>I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</em> <strong> -Michael Jordan</strong></blockquote></p>
