           <p> My name is <strong> Karina Montes.</strong><br> I was born in Mexico City and I'm currently learning <em>how to program.</em> I recently graduated from UTSA. <br> Fun fact: I took one semester of Japanese because I wan't to travel to Japan.</p>     	
            <blockquote>"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. <em>I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."</em> <strong> -Michael Jordan</strong></blockquote></p>
